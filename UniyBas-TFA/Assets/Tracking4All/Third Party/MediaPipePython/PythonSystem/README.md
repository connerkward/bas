License is the same as the license you got Tracking4All with.

These exemplars serve MediaPipe in Python over UDP sockets. This is an alternative to using the third party Unity Mediapipe Plugin.

This makes the backend very developer accesible (you do not need to use C++ to modify the tracking and can use whatever familiar Python libraries you want).

This approach to running the tracking solution is only supported where you can run Python on the device or remotely. 

NOTE: the framework has been designed so that you can easily swap between the Python based tracking solution and the Mediapipe Unity plugin whenever you want.
